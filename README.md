# Twitter Sentiment Analysis using LSTM Neural Networks

This project demonstrates a deep learning approach to **Twitter sentiment analysis** using an **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network**. The model is trained on a dataset of tweets and learns to predict whether a tweet has a negative or positive sentiment.

**[Open the Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ZeshanRasul/LSTM_Sentiment_Analysis/blob/main/LSTM_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb) to explore the code, results and analysis.**

## Project Overview

- **Objective:** Train an LSTM model to analyse sentiments in tweets.
- **Dataset:** This project uses a Kaggle dataset which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arkhoshghalb/twitter-sentiment-analysis-hatred-speech).
- **Model:** Deep learning sentiment classifier using **LSTM**.
- **Analysis:** Include data preprocessing, model training, evaluation metrics and insights.
- **Tools:** Python, Tensorflow/Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, NLTK.

## Key Features

- Preprocessing pipeline with tokenization with NLTK and GloVe for word embedding
